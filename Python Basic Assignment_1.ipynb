    "1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer \n",
    "or string and expressions will be mathematical operators. \n",
    "*\n",
    "hello\n",
    "-87.8 \n",
    "- \n",
    "/ \n",
    "+ \n",
    "6\n",

    "-87.8 values\n",
    "- expression\n",
    "/ expression\n",
    "+ expression\n",
    "6 values\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "Ans:Variable are used to store data in form of integar,string and more data type. However \n",
    "    string is a form of data type which denotes within single or double quotation and are \n",
    "    immutable for ex a = \"ram\" here a is variable and \"ram\" is string data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "Ans.There different data types :\n",
    "   1. Numeric data type. These data types has numeric value like integar, floating number or \n",
    "   complex number.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   2.String. String is a form of data type which denotes within single or double quotation and \n",
    "   are immutable for example a = \"ram\" here \"ram\" is string data type.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   3.Dictionary. Dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.Dictionaries are \n",
    "   defined within braces{} in form of key:value pair. Key and value can be of any type.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "Ans.Expression is a combination of values and functions. Values and functions are combined and \n",
    "    interpreted by the compiler to create a new value.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an\n",
    "   expression and a statement?\n",
    "Ans.Statement cannot be reduced to any value like spam = 10. However expression can produce some \n",
    "   value and it is a combination of variable and operations with value that results in any value. \n",
    "   for example 10 + 3\n",
    "\n",
    "6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",
    "bacon + 1\n",
    "Ans. 22\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    " 'spam'+ 'spamspam'\n",
    " 'spam' * 3 \n",
    "Ans. For both two terms it will be same output that is 'spamspamspam' \n",
    "\n",
    "8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "Ans. It is a rule of paython that variable cannot start with the number and can only contain alpha \n",
    "     numeric characters and underscores.\n",
    "     \n",
    "9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string\n",
    "version of a value?\n",
    "Ans. We can use following functions:\n",
    "    1. integer = int()\n",
    "    2. floating-point number = float()\n",
    "    3. string = str()\n",
    "      \n",
    "10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "    'I have eaten' + 99 + 'burritos.'\n",
    "Ans.This expression cause an error because as per rule we can only concatenate string with string \n",
    "    only not integer. If we change 99 to string by putting it in '99' single or double quotation.\n",
    "    'I have eaten' +' 99 ' + 'burritos.'\n",
