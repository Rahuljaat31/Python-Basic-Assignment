    " 1. What is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. The re.compile() function returns Regex objects.\n",
    "     import re\n",
    "     re.compile(\"x\")\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Raw strings are used so that backslashes do not have to be escaped.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the return value of the search() method?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. The search() function returns the first location where it finds the match. If no match is \n",
    "     found it will return none.\n",
    "     Example in below code\n",
    "\n",
    "4. From a Match item, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Explained in below code \n",
    "\n",
    "5. In the regex which created from the r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)', what does group \n",
    "   zero cover? Group 2? Group 1?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. group zero will cover '420-111-8400'or (\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)\n",
    "     group 2 will cover '111-8400' or (\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)\n",
    "     group 1 will cover '420' or (\\d\\d\\d)\n",
    "     Explained in below code with the digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. In standard expression syntax, parentheses and intervals have distinct meanings. How can you \n",
    "   tell a regex that you want it to fit real parentheses and periods?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Periods and parentheses can be escaped with a backslash: \\., \\(, and \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The findall() method returns a string list or a list of string tuples. What causes it to \n",
    "   return one of the two options?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. If the regex has no groups, a list of strings is returned. If the regex has groups, a list \n",
    "    of tuples of strings is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. In standard expressions, what does the | character mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. The character | is called pipe and | is used to match “either, or” between two groups.\n",
    "     Explained in below code.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. In regular expressions, what does the character stand for?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Each character in a regular expression (that is, each character in the string describing its \n",
    "     pattern) is either a metacharacter, having a special meaning, or a regular character that \n",
    "     has a literal meaning. For example, in the regex b., 'b' is a literal character that matches \n",
    "     just 'b', while '.' is a metacharacter that matches every character except a newline.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. In regular expressions, what is the difference between the + and * characters?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. In regular expressions, '+' operator denotes repetition of operand 1 or more times and \n",
    "    '*'  denotes the repetition of operand for zero or more times.       \n",
    "    \n",
    "11. What is the difference between {4} and {4,5} in regular expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. The {4} matches exactly four instances of the preceding group.The {4,5} matches between \n",
    "     four and five instances. Explained in below code\n",
    "\n",
    "12. What do you mean by the \\d, \\w, and \\s shorthand character classes signify in regular\n",
    "    expressions?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. The \\d, \\w, and \\s shorthand character classes match a single digit, word, or space \n",
    "     character, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What do means by \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. The \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes match a single character that is not a digit, \n",
    "     word, or space character, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the difference between .*? and .*?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. .* is a greedy mode, which returns the longest string that meets the condition. \n",
    "     Whereas .*? is a non greedy mode which returns the shortest string that meets the condition.\n",
    "     Example in below code\n",
    "\n",
    "15. What is the syntax for matching both numbers and lowercase letters with a character class?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Syntax is Either [a-z0-9] or [0-9a-z]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "16. What is the procedure for making a normal expression in regax case insensitive?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. We can pass re.IGNORECASE as a flag to make a normal expression case insensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. What does the . character normally match? What does it match if re.DOTALL is passed as 2nd\n",
    "    argument in re.compile()?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Dot . character matches everything in input except newline character .By passing re.DOTALL        as a flag to re.compile(), you can make the dot character match all characters, including        the newline character.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. If numReg = re.compile(r'\\d+'), what will numRegex.sub('X', '11 drummers, 10 pipers, five         rings, 4 hen') return?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. The Ouput will be 'X drummers, X pipers, five rings, X hen'\n",
    "     Explained in below code.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "19. What does passing re.VERBOSE as the 2nd argument to re.compile() allow to do?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. re.VERBOSE will allow to add whitespace and comments to string passed to re.compile().\n",
    "\n",
    "20. How would you write a regex that match a number with comma for every three digits? It must\n",
    "    match the given following:\n",
    "    '42'\n",
    "    '1,234'\n",
    "    '6,368,745'\n",
    "    but not the following: \n",

    "    '1234' (which lacks commas)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Explained in below code\n",
    "\n",
    "21. How would you write a regex that matches the full name of someone whose last name is\n",
    "    Watanabe? You can assume that the first name that comes before it will always be one word         that begins with a capital letter. The regex must match the following:\n",
    "    'Haruto Watanabe'\n",
    "    'Alice Watanabe'\n",
    "    'RoboCop Watanabe'\n",

    "    Bob, or Carol; the second word is either eats, pets, or throws; the third word is apples,         cats,or baseballs; and the sentence ends with a period? This regex should be case-               insensitive. It must match the following:\n",
    "    'Alice eats apples.'\n",
    "    'Bob pets cats.'\n",
    "    'Carol throws baseballs.'\n",
